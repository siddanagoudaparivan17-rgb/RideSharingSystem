# RideSharingSystem
Java program simulates a ride-sharing system with OOP. Abstract class Ride holds driver, vehicle, and distance with abstract calculateFare(). Subclasses BikeRide and CarRide compute fares as distance×10 or ×20. User enters ride type and distance; system shows details. Invalid ride types throw a custom exception.
